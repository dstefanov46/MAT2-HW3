# Homework 3 in the Subject Mathematics 2

The version of ```R``` used for this homework is **4.2.0**.

In the files ```MH_part.R```, ```HMC_part.R``` and ```rejection_part.R``` we have the code
for all the experiments regarding a particular sampling algorithm. In the file ```helper_funcs.R```
we have defined functions which are used by the code for each algorithm. And, the files ```datset.csv```, ```HMC.R``` 
and ```Multiplot.R``` are the ones which we're provided to us during lectures.
